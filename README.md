# Human Activity Recognition with CNN-LSTM and Residual Connections

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** model using the **WISDM dataset**.  
The dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data collected from smartphones.  
The proposed model combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)** and integrates **residual connections** to enhance feature extraction and improve gradient flow.

The model achieved **~94% accuracy** with augmentation applied, making it suitable for academic and engineering exploration.

## üéØ Motivation
- Human activities generate sequential time-series signals from sensors.  
- Classical ML methods often fail to capture **temporal dependencies** and **complex motion patterns**.  
- This project leverages:
  - **CNNs** for local temporal feature extraction.  
  - **Residual connections** for stable training of deeper CNNs.  
  - **LSTMs** for long-term sequential modeling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing
- **Dataset:** [WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining)](https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php).  
- **Challenge:** Class imbalance in activity distribution.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Applied **data augmentation** using the **jittering technique** (adding Gaussian noise).  
  - Augmentation performed on both training and test sets to increase variability and improve robustness.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture
The CNN-LSTM model with residual connections is structured as follows:

1. **Input Layer**  
   - Time-series windows from accelerometer & gyroscope data.  

2. **CNN Block 1**  
   - Conv1D (64 filters, kernel size 5) + BatchNorm + Dropout.  
   - Residual Conv1D (64 filters) added back to the block output.  

3. **CNN Block 2**  
   - Conv1D (128 filters) + BatchNorm + Dropout.  

4. **LSTM Layer**  
   - LSTM (128 units) to capture long-term dependencies.  

5. **Dense Layers**  
   - Dense (128 units, ReLU) + Dropout.  
   - Final Dense layer with **Softmax activation** for multi-class classification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training Strategy
- **Cross-validation:** 5-fold **Stratified K-Fold**.  
- **Optimizer:** Adam.  
- **Loss Function:** Sparse categorical cross-entropy.  
- **Regularization:**  
  - L2 weight decay.  
  - Dropout.  
  - Early stopping & ReduceLROnPlateau.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy.  
  - Macro F1-score.  
  - Detailed classification reports per fold.

## üìä Results
- Achieved an average **accuracy of ~94%** on the WISDM dataset.  
- Residual connections and the CNN-LSTM hybrid improved performance over standalone CNN or LSTM baselines.  
- Macro F1-scores across folds showed **balanced classification across both majority and minority activity classes**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- This work was conducted for **academic and experimental purposes**.  
- Results are not intended as an official benchmark submission.  
- Data augmentation (jittering) was applied to improve robustness but may not reflect standardized evaluation protocols.
